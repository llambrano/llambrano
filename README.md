## Hi, I'm Libardo ðŸ‘‹
![](images/GitHub_Cover_Libardo.png)

I'm a performance marketing leader who is passionate about data and analytics. I love research and data analysis. Nothing makes me happier than uncovering and sharing hidden insights behind the data. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Python for analytics (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau, MicroStrategy, Adobe Analytics, APIs, Markdown, SQL. Decisions that are not data-driven, make me turn red.
